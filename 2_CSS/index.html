                            <p>The first fundamental step in the web application development process is to deeply analyze the project and its most important elements. Your development team should explore your needs, the project scope, and the functionalities needed.</p>

                            <p>Now it’s time to determine how your product will look to satisfy your users. This is when we need to carefully consider the product’s visual side, its design and architecture. The work may differ depending on the project. Interface development requires us to pay attention to every detail so that the product is not only functional but also user-friendly.</p>

The process is run by a dedicated project manager who ensures smooth cooperation between the development team and the client. Software development is an iterative process that usually takes place in a strictly defined cycle that is divided into smaller stages.</p>

                            <p>Here comes the post-development phase. After launching the application, you should continue to monitor it. Monitoring and further web app development are aimed at tracking the way your product works to detect any errors as soon as possible. We always implement app monitoring tools that enable fast response times in the event of any failure. Monitoring keeps your app safe, working properly, and attractive to your target group.</p>
